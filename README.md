# mps2asc
A small utility to convert MITK Point Sets to simple .asc

This utility helps you to convert MITK point sets (`.mps`), that were generated and exported using the [Medical Imaging Toolkit](https://github.com/MITK/MITK) to a simple ASCII point set text file (`.asc`).
These files can then be opened and further processed with other software, like [Meshlab](https://www.meshlab.net/).

## Prerequisites
[.NET 6](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/) is needed for execution.

## Usage
Simply download the current version from release, and drag your `.mps` file on the application. It will generated an equally named `.asc` file in the same folder. :)
